How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I typically like to draw out my base design using a flow chart. After this is created I have a much more simplistic way to combat that problem. 
If it is easy though I will just dive in and start coding. Being able to design 3D objects using only primitive shapes was a difficult concept
to grasp early on. The cram it all into the last week design process. 


What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Writing Modular code helped me later on in this project big time. I was essentially trying to hard code everything into the main method to start
because I didn't fully grasp the concepts and classes. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Well my biggst goals outside of finishing school and getting out of the army are becoming a game Developer. This class was a very good start to that and I am excited to see what the future holds.
